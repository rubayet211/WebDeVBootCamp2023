Technologies
Throughout my web development journey, I have gained hands-on experience with a wide range of technologies and tools. Here are some of the key technologies I have worked with:

HTML5 and CSS3: The building blocks of every web page, enabling me to structure and style content effectively.

JavaScript: The programming language that powers interactivity and dynamic behavior on the web.

React: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing me to create interactive and reusable components.

Node.js and Express: A server-side runtime and web application framework that enables the development of robust and scalable backend systems.

MongoDB: A flexible and scalable NoSQL database that I have used for persisting data in my applications.

This is just a glimpse of the technologies I have explored so far, and I'm constantly expanding my skill set by learning new tools and frameworks.

Learning Resources
Learning web development requires continuous self-improvement and staying up to date with the latest industry trends. Here are some valuable resources that have played a crucial role in my learning journey:

Website 1: A comprehensive online tutorial platform offering in-depth courses on various web development topics.

Website 2: A popular coding community where developers can share knowledge, seek guidance, and collaborate on projects.

Website 3: A curated collection of web development articles, tutorials, and resources contributed by the community.
